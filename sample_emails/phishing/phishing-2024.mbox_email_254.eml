r the expenses they reasonably incurred and will incur in litigating this c=
ase on behalf of Settlement Class Members in an amount not to exceed $225,0=
00. Oracle has reserved the right to object or comment on Class Counsel=E2=

urt and has also agreed not to appeal any order of the District Court award=
ing attorneys=E2=80=99 fees and expenses. Class Counsel will also ask the C=
ourt to approve Service Awards of up to $10,000 each for the two Class Repr=
esentatives named in the complaint as an award for their service to the Set=
tlement Class as Plaintiffs and Class Representatives ($20,000 in total) ou=

iously-visited page) associated with a website user or (b) except for Oracl=
e=E2=80=99s own websites, any text entered by a user in an online web form,=

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09<p style=3D"font-size: 13px;">A Settlement has been=
 proposed in class action litigation against Oracle America, Inc. (&ldquo;O=
racle&rdquo;). This class action alleges that Oracle improperly captured, c=
ompiled, and sold individuals&rsquo; online and offline data to third parti=
es without obtaining their consent. Oracle denies all the allegations made =
in the lawsuit and any wrongdoing and maintains that its practices were law=
ful and disclosed to individuals.</p>

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09<p style=3D"font-size: 13px;"><strong>Who is includ=
ed in the Settlement?</strong> You are included if you are a Settlement Cla=
ss Member, which is defined as &ldquo;all natural persons residing in the U=
nited States whose personal information, or data derived from their persona=
l information, was acquired, captured, or otherwise collected by Oracle Adv=
ertising technologies or made available for use or sale by or through ID Gr=
aph, Data Marketplace, or any other Oracle Advertising product or service f=
rom August 19, 2018 to the date of final judgment in the Action.&rdquo;</p>

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09<p style=3D"font-size: 13px;"><strong>What does the=
 Settlement provide?</strong> Under the Settlement, Oracle will pay $115 mi=

llion) for attorneys&rsquo; fees. In addition, Class Counsel will ask the C=
ourt to reimburse them out of the Settlement Fund for the expenses they rea=
sonably incurred and will incur in litigating this case on behalf of Settle=
ment Class Members in an amount not to exceed $225,000. Oracle has reserved=
 the right to object or comment on Class Counsel&rsquo;s request for attorn=
eys&rsquo; fees and expenses in the District Court and has also agreed not =
to appeal any order of the District Court awarding attorneys&rsquo; fees an=
d expenses. Class Counsel will also ask the Court to approve Service Awards=
